# Easy Postgres

**Abstraction layer for PostgreSQL database manipulation based on the `psycopg2` package**

Primary focuses are **lightweight API** and **high flexibility** when it comes to handling user input. This should make the package very easy to use while maintaining a usable performance level.

## WARNING: Work in Progress

*This package is currently under heavy development and should NOT be used in production. The current API is very likely to change in the near future.*
